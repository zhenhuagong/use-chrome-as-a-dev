## Use Chrome As A Dev

For web developers(like me), Chrome is more than just a web browser. It provides many features which can facilitate our development process. It's so powerful that it is absolutely rewarding to explore more about it for better development experience.

I've learned some knowledge of it for the past few years. But they're too scattered, like seperate dots. Meanwhile, Chrome is fastly evolving each day as well. There is always something new to learn.

So I decided to create this repository to connect those dots I've learned before and keep myself updated with features and power that is newly shipped on Chrome.

Many thanks to Chrome Team.
